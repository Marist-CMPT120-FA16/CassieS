HAUNTED HOU...' \n\n That last word isn't finished and there looks to be blood on the page. You don't want to think about what's happened to Sam. You run to the Haunted House and carefully sneak back into the building. \n\nIt's impossible! You'll NEVER find Sam. Dejected, you collapse against the wall. WHAT?! The wall moved. Quietly, you open the door to a secret room. There's a hole in the center. You shine the flashlight down. IT'S SAM!!\n\n 'SAM!! SAM!! WAKE UP!'\n\n'"+name+"? Is that you?'\n\n'Yeah, are you okay?'\n\n'I'm...not sure. I don't know what happened...' \n\n Using the rope, you quickly lower it down and a groggy but alert Sam climbs out of the hole. \n\n Looking around, you notice a security door. Using the ID card, you are able to scan it and open the door. You run to the nearest exit, into your car, and race out of the park until you reach home! \n\nOMG YOU MADE IT!!! You're both SAFE!!")
