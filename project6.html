Modeled after the Winchester Mystery House, it's supposedly filled with weird rooms, dead ends, and strange entertainments. Hopefully, everyone has gone home...",key);
loc1 = new Location (1,"Wicked Waters: A water park. Simple enough. But why is the water so cloudy? And how would anyone survive that drop??");
loc2 = new Location (2,"Death by Coaster: Sneaking quietly along the walkway, the monstrous roller coaster comes into view. Already voted 'Most terrifying ride in the world', the ride twists and turns through the night sky like a snake. 'Death by Coaster.' That HAS to be an exaggeration...right?");
loc3 = new Location (3,"Circus of Horrors: A large red and white striped, tent-like building. 'Circus of Horrors.' Oh God. This is the LAST place you wanted to be. Coulrophobia is NOT for the faint of heart. Does that say 'Side Show', too??");
loc4 = new Location (4,"Creepy Confections: This place doesn't look that bad. Yeah, it says 'Creepy Confections,' but how bad can a few shops & restaurants be?");
loc5 = new Location (5,"Insect Infestation: The Insect Infestation attraction is part zoo/part 'hands on experience' that is quote 'intended to education as well as terrify' unquote. You did NOT want to know what they meant by that.");
loc6 = new Location (6,"Children's Dreams: A playground. Of sorts. The rides are like traditional kids rides, but....off.");
loc7 = new Location (7,"Severed Stadium: It says 'stadium' but it looks more like the Roman Colliseum. How bizarre! Then you remember some of the 'attractions' the Colliseum used to present...");
loc8 = new Location (8,"Creatures from the Deep: An insanely large aquarium, this attraction, too, has made headlines. But, honestly, a shark is a shark, right?");
loc9 = new Location (9,"Zombie Zoo: Part zoo, part drive-thru safari, all terrifying. Even now you can hear the sounds of animals. Sounds you don't recognize. But Sam LOVED animals, so you have to look here. As you approach the hideous gate, made to look like a way too realistic alligator gone undead, you notice a key card wedged between two of the teeth. For a cement 'gate', those teeth look awfully sharp...");

You find some excuse to not go, and you wind up being pretty much the only one. The next day, people are raving about how scary/fun it is. You HAVE to go they say. However, in the days afterward, your best friend Sam has gone missing. Everyone has a theory, but only YOU KNOW it was that place. It's up to you to investigate, so, tonight, you're going to find Sam. Click North to jump the fence & enter the park.");}
